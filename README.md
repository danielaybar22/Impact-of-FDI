# Impact-of-FDI

This paper assessed the impact of FDI on former 20th century colony states and how this differed from the effect of FDI on non-former colony states. A simple linear regression was used to assess the raw impact of FDI on these two groups without accounting for other factors. Multiple linear regression was used to add dummy variables which include: education level, corruption, economic instability, and trade openness to the model. In addition, interaction terms were added to determine how the impact of FDI changed based on different underlying economic circumstances.
